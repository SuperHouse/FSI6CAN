Flysky FS-i6 CAN Interface
==========================

Mounts inside a Flysky FS-i6 remote control transmitter to provide a
CAN bus interface for external control, so it can send and receive
commands from external input devices. This replaces the control normally
done using the built-in joysticks.

Intended for use with the Chair Breakout Mini, which interfaces with
assistive input devices including wheelchair joysticks and button
boxes and gives them a CAN bus interface.

This allows the wheelchair controls to be used to fly a drone or R/C
plane, or drive an R/C car.

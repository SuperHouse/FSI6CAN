Firmware for the FSi6 CAN Bus Interface
========================================
Copyright 2018-2020 SuperHouse Automation Pty Ltd <www.superhouse.tv>  

Firmware for the FSi6CAN (CAN bus interface for Flysky FSi6) which
allows the transmitter to be connected to a CAN bus and receive
commands from external input devices.

Intended for use with the Chair Breakout Mini, which interfaces with
assistive input devices including wheelchair joysticks and button
boxes and gives them a CAN bus interface.

This allows the wheelchair controls to be used to fly a drone or R/C
plane, or drive an R/C car.
